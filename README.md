# PROJECT "Personal_Travel_Blog":
As the name says,[https://travelblog-362615.uc.r.appspot.com/] is a persoanl travel blog 

## Why I chose to make this
I like to make projects that I can actaully use rather than just making making projects for the sake of it.So I made a Travel Blog because I love to travel and am aadrenaline junkie, so blog to post my travels and activities was a useful project that I could test/develop my skills working on while it being useful after its done. The project also requires auth to be able to do any chnages to blog or make a new one, so only me or user I authorize can edit the blog.
